This small project shows how to show a view with 2 textfields and each one using the same custom (numeric) keyboard.

I am very new to Xcode and Swift/SwiftUI, and so the code can probably be improved upon.

I cannot claim that this work is my own as it is based on code in a Kavsoft video (which is referenced in the code) and also by numerous StackOverflow articles.

I am even newer to GitHub and I am not really sure how all this works.
